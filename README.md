## 💡 About

This portfolio is a simple and clean landing page built with just **HTML5** and **CSS3** – no frameworks, no JavaScript.  
It was designed to present myself and showcase my work in a responsive and accessible way.

📌 **Planned improvements**:
- Add interactivity with **JavaScript** (like dark mode, animations, etc.)
