## 💡 About

This portfolio is a simple and clean landing page built with just ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?logo=html5&logoColor=white) and ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?logo=css3&logoColor=white) – no frameworks, no JavaScript.  
It was designed to present myself and showcase my work in a responsive and accessible way.

📌 **Planned improvements**:
- Add interactivity with **JavaScript** (like dark mode, animations, etc.)
